# Over.ai

[Over.ai](https://over.ai/) is the open-source web app development framework that makes it easy to
build top quality progressive web apps with web technologies.

Over.ai is based on [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and comes with many significant performance, usability, and feature improvements over the past versions.
